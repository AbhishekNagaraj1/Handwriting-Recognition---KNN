# Handwriting-Recognition---KNN
(1) Data Analysis and Machine Learning - Handwritten Digits Recognition using KNN algorithm (No Libraries). 
(2) Best Obtained accuracy is 0.96925 (For K = 3).  
(3) Accuracy decreases as the K-value increases.  
(4) When the K value is large, smoothening effect on the dataset decreases the variance and hence the negativity of the performance.
