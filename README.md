# Handwriting-Recognition---KNN
(1) Data Analysis and Machine Learning - Handwritten Digits Recognition using KNN algorithm (No inbuilt Libraries used).  
(2) Data Set Contains 70000 images of handwritten digits - Divided into 60000 images as training data set and 10000 images as test data set.  
(3) Each image has 28x28 pixels which are considered as the features for the image.

(4) Best Obtained accuracy is 0.96925 (For K = 3).  
(5) Accuracy decreases as the K-value increases.  
(6) When the K value is large, smoothening effect on the dataset decreases the variance and hence the negativity of the performance.
