# Handwriting-Recognition---KNN
Data Analysis and Machine Learning - Handwritten Digits Recognition using KNN algorithm (No Libraries)
Best Obtained accuracy is 0.96925 (For K = 3)
Accuracy decreases as the K-value increases
When the K value is large, smoothening effect on the dataset decreases the variance and hence the negativity of the performance
